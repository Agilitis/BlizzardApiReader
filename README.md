# BlizzardApiReader
.net framework C# project, reads the api for blizzard games and convert them to C# objects, currently only supports diablo 3

# More work need to be done
Not all of the Api requests are done, if you wish to add some, please do.

# Api key
Make sure you have a file named apikey.txt in your BlizzardApiReader directory with your unique api key.
To get an Api key go to https://dev.battle.net/

# Contributing
Anyone is welcome to contribue to this project.
I do not own any other Blizzard games other than Diablo 3 therefore I will not work on other Blizzard Apis.
You are more than welcome adding more api requests to this projects.

# Note
This is just a project I work on my spare time, it nothing special, out of the ordinary, feel free to do whatever you want with the code.
