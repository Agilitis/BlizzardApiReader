# Blizzard ApiReader
C# .net Core library wrapper for Blizzard Public APIs

# First timers friendly
As I am also new to open source projects, I want to make this project first-timer friendly as much as possible.
Don't be afraid to try and contribute and make mistakes, then we can learn and improve together.
This project is also a learning process for me, please tell me if I am doing anything wrong.
