# BlizzardApiReader
.net framework C# projects tha reads the api for blizzard games and convert them to C# objects, currently only supports diablo 3

# More work need to be done
Not all of the Api requests are done, if you wish to add some, please do.

# Contributing
Anyone is welcome to contribue to this project.
I do not own any other Blizzard games other than Diablo 3 therefore I will not work on other Blizzard Apis.
You are more than welcome adding more api requests, however as you can see this project's structure needs to be updated first to better support more than one game, probably divide the api requests for each game into different namespaces.

# Note
This is just a project I work on my spare time, it nothing special, out of the ordinary, feel free to do whatever you want with the code.
