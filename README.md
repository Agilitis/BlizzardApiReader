# Blizzard ApiReader
C# .net framework project, reads the Blizzard API and gets a response as json and converts them to objects, simple as that.
This library can be used if you wish to create an application or software that require you to use any of Blizzard many APIs.

# First timers friendly
As I am also new to open source projects, I want to make this project first timer friendly as much as possible.
Don't be afraid to try and contribute and make mistakes, then we can learn and improve together.
This project is also a learning process to me, please tell me if I am doing anything wrong.

# Setup
1) Fork this repo and then clone it
2) Compile it and put the compiled dll inside your project.


# Usage
You will need to apply for an API key, head to https://dev.battle.net/ to get one.
After that, see the Setup section above and make sure you follow all the steps.  
Read the wiki for more detailed information about this library, though methods are pretty straight forward.

# Contributing
Anyone is welcome to contribue to this project.
I do not own any other Blizzard games other than Diablo 3 therefore I will NOT work on other Blizzard Apis.
You are more than welcome adding more api requests to this projects.
Currently, Blizard have an api for Diablo, Wow and Starcraft. The aim is to support all 3 games.
There is also unoffical hearthstone api, I am okay with implementing that as well. (http://hearthstoneapi.com/)

# Pull requests
From now, all changes will be pushed into the development branch before merging into the master branch.

# Goals
Complete all the API requests available for all games.  
Unit tests coverage for the project.  
*Optional* OAuth implementation.  
Ongoing code refactor and improvements.
*switch to .net core*
